# Privacy & AI Notes

Quick notes about data privacy relevant to AI usage in class:

- This project stores data locally in browser LocalStorage. No data is sent to a server by default.
- When using AI tools, students should avoid pasting any personally identifiable information into prompts.
- Example safe prompt: "Create QUnit tests for formatDateISO" (no student data).  
- Example unsafe prompt: "Fix this import that contains student emails: <paste emails>" â€” DO NOT paste sensitive data.
- Teachers should sanitize any real student data before including it in examples.
